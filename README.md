<h2>About Me <img align="right" alt="Profile Hits" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=mdcrab02&style=flat-square"></h2>

<p align="justify">I am a former web developer turned data scientist and quantum hobbyist.</p>

<p align="justify">I started developing in .Net with C# and Javascript, but have since left web development behind as I love data science.  My primary languages now are Python, R, and SQL (if you count that as a language)!</p>

<p align="justify">Although I'm a people leader now, I'll always love programming for fun.  I also like to create repositories that can be followed like a tutorial with the purpose of helping others.  That's why you will often see notes in my scripts that explain the code in sometimes excruciating detail :)</p>
